    <h1> About Vuetify Todo</h1>
    <br>
    <p>One of the most important reasons you should use a to do list is that it will help you stay organised.
         When you write all your tasks in a list, they seem more manageable. When you've got a clear outline of the tasks you've got to do and those you've completed, it helps you stay focused.</p>
    <br>
    <p>This application will be like a task keeper where the user would be able to enter the tasks that they need to do.
        Once they are done with their tasks they can also remove them from the list.</p>
